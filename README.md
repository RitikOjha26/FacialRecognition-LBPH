# FacialRecognition-LBPH
# Facial Recognition with LBPH

This project implements facial recognition using the Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) algorithm. LBPH is a powerful technique for facial recognition that works well in various lighting conditions.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

### 1. Training Data

- Download the training data archive file with a `.yml` extension.
- Extract the contents of the archive file.

### 2. Load Model Video

- Open the project and load the video file in which you want to perform facial recognition.
- The project will save the test data images to a new folder named "images."

### 3. Load Model Image

- Load a model image that represents the face you want to recognize.

### 4. Provide Training Data Source Path

- In the code, provide the source path of the training data images obtained from step 1.

### 5. Run Facial Recognition

- Execute the facial recognition script.
- The program will use the LBPH algorithm to recognize faces in the video based on the provided model image and training data.
